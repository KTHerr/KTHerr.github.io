### Hi, I'm Katie Herr
_Postdoctoral researcher and NIH IRACDA FIRST Fellow at Emory University_


 My passions for biological research and inclusive teaching have motivated my career. Currently, my research is focused on the evolutionary dynamics of insect-microbe symbiosis, using diverse host and microbe systems. To pursue this research, I've developed expertise in microbial dynamics, evolutionary biology, next generation sequencing and bioinformatics.
