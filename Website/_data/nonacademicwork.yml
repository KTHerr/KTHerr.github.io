   Participated in field research studying pollination biology of Joshua trees (<i>Yucca brevifolia</i>) and coevolution with yucca moths (genus <i>Tegeticula</i>) in Delamar Valley, Lincoln County NV.
    Installed pollinator exclusion cages, collected flower and leaf samples, and captured yucca moths for study.
    Endured challenging field conditions such as extreme weather events and limited water supply. 
    Worked and camped in close proximity with a team of four other researchers.
    Traveled several miles each day carrying water and heavy equipment.
