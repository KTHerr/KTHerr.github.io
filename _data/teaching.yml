    <ul>
    <li>Designed learning outcomes and developed a case study from my own research to teach upper-
    level approaches to bioinformatic analysis and interpretation of next generation sequencing data.</li>
    <li>Utilized active learning strategies (think-pair-share, popcorn, PollEverywhere survey) to engage
      students, promote in-class discussion, and assess student take-aways.</li>
    <li>Learning outcomes:
      <ul>
      <li> Learn how both genomic and metagenomic sequencing can be harnessed to explore hypotheses</li>
      <li>Explore trade-offs from different types of sequencing (genomic vs. metagenomic) and different
      levels of sequencing (shallow vs. deep)</li>
      </ul></li>
